# ZK Bootcamp Repository

Welcome to my ZK Scaling Bootcamp journey! 🚀

In this repository, I’m diving deep into **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) layers**, exploring their potential, and experimenting with various projects. The main goal here is to gain hands-on experience and knowledge in ZK technology, a cornerstone of privacy and scalability in the blockchain space.

## ZK Layers I’m Exploring 🧠

- **Aztec**: Focusing on privacy and scalability through efficient ZK rollups.
- **Mina**: Known as the "succinct blockchain", Mina is designed to maintain a small, lightweight blockchain using zk-SNARKs.

## What You’ll Find Here 🗂️

This repo contains various projects and exercises as I experiment with these ZK layers. Check out the subdirectories for more specific implementations and details. These are mainly exercise that you can also find in each Layer documentation.

### How to Run 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zk-bootcamp.git

2. Navigate to the project you're interested in (Aztec or Mina):
```bash
cd Aztec/hello_world

# or
cd Mina/sudoku

```

Follow the setup instructions in the respective folders.
